# GoalBets - Interactive Betting System

**University of Mauritius**  
**Module: Interactive System Design (SIS2044Y)**  
**Lecturer: Ms. Lakshi Meghoo**

## Project Overview

GoalBets is a mobile betting application prototype developed as part of our Interactive System Design module. This project focuses on applying core HCI principles—usability, learnability, and ethical design—to create a secure, intuitive, and responsible gambling platform.

The system is designed to address common user frustrations identified through extensive research, such as cluttered interfaces, lack of transparency, and poor responsible gambling tools.

## Key Features (Java Implementation)

This repository contains the Java code for the core backend and application logic of the GoalBets system. Key implemented functionalities include:

*   **User Account Management:** Registration, login, and age verification.
*   **Betting Logic:** Core algorithms for handling bets, calculating odds, and processing winnings.
*   **Wallet System:** Simulated deposit, withdrawal, and balance tracking.
*   **Data Persistence:** Management of user data, bet history, and event information.
*   **Responsible Gambling Features:** Foundation for implementing betting limits and user controls.

## Technology Stack

*   **Language:** Java
*   **Potential Frameworks:** JavaFX (for a desktop prototype GUI) or Spring Boot (for a backend API)
*   **Build Tool:** Maven or Gradle
*   **Version Control:** Git / GitHub
